## 🔐 Task 2 – Incident Response with Splunk SIEM  

This project demonstrates **monitoring and analyzing security logs** using Splunk Cloud (Free Trial). The goal was to simulate **real-world SOC operations**: detecting suspicious activities, classifying incidents, and preparing an **incident response report**.  

---

## 📖 Task Overview  
- Ingested sample **web access logs** into Splunk.  
- Ran searches to detect anomalies (e.g., 404 errors, failed login attempts, SQL injection probes).  
- Created an **Incident Response Report** with screenshots and findings.  
- Uploaded the report for documentation and review.

## 📂 Repository Contents  
- `README.md` → Project summary.  
- `Task2_Incident_Report_With_Screenshots.pdf` → Final report with analysis + screenshots.

## 📝 Key Learnings  
- Basics of **SIEM operations** (searching, filtering, visualizing logs).  
- Identifying suspicious traffic patterns like:  
  - Multiple failed login attempts  
  - SQL injection probes (`' OR 1=1 --`)  
  - Repeated 404 errors on API endpoints  
- Drafting a **structured incident response report**.  

 
- Perform deeper log correlation for lateral movement detection.  
- Add **Task 3** once completed.
