# Task 2 – SIEM & Incident Response (Splunk)

This task involved using **Splunk** to analyze sample web access logs for suspicious activity such as:
- Unauthorized access attempts (401/403 errors)
- Brute force login attempts
- SQL Injection probes
- General error trends

The objective was to simulate a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** workflow:
1. Ingest sample log data into Splunk.
2. Run structured searches to detect anomalies.
3. Document findings and classify incidents.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Multiple failed login attempts** (potential brute force) detected from IP `203.0.113.45`.
- **Unauthorized access attempts** to `/login`, `/products`, and suspicious traversal attempts (`../../../etc/passwd`).
- **No SQL injection probes** were detected in this dataset.
- General 404 errors were observed, but not critical.

## 📊 Evidence
Screenshots of Splunk searches and results have been included in the report.

## 🚀 Learning Outcome
- Hands-on experience with **Splunk SIEM** for log ingestion and searching.
- Practical understanding of **incident detection** and classification.
- Exposure to real-world SOC workflows like brute force detection, error monitoring, and attack pattern searches.
